            <img src="/COGNIFYZ/Level 1/Task1/images/fox.jpg" alt="fox">
            <p>Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae.
                They have a flattened skull, upright, triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long
                bushy tail ("brush").

                Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true fox" group of genus Vulpes. Approximately another 25
                current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the
                paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the
                bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.[1]

                Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species of fox is the
                red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.[2] The global distribution of foxes,
                together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular
                culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long
                an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to
                various parts of the New World

            <h2>Tiger</h2>
            <img src="/COGNIFYZ/Level 1/Task1/images/bengal-tiger.jpg" alt="bengal-tiger">
            <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is
                most
                recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it
                primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but
                social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and
                rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become
                independent,
                leaving their mother's home range to establish their own.</p>

            <h2>Bear</h2>
            <img src="/COGNIFYZ/Level 1/Task1/images/bear.jpg" alt="bear">
            <p>Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae They are classified as caniforms,
                or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing
                in a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern
                Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, and Eurasia. Common
                characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears,
                shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.Bears have been hunted
                since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have also been used for bear-baiting and other
                forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their powerful physical presence, they play a
                prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern
                times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear
                parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or
                endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in
                certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are
                prohibited, but still ongoing.</p>
